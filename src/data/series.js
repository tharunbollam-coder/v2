"That's strange," Luna whispered to herself. "I've never seen anything like that before."

Curious, she tiptoed toward the glow and discovered the most beautiful mushroom she had ever seen. It was as tall as her knee and sparkled with tiny blue and silver lights, like stars had been captured inside it.

Suddenly, a tiny voice squeaked, "Don't touch it! That's my home!"`,

A small fairy, no bigger than Luna's thumb, flew out from behind the mushroom. She had sparkly wings and wore a dress made of flower petals.

"I'm Pip," said the fairy. "And you've found the Gateway Mushroom! It only glows for children who have kind hearts and brave spirits."

Luna's eyes widened with wonder. "A real fairy! And what's a Gateway Mushroom?"

Pip smiled. "It's the entrance to the magical part of the Whispering Woods. Would you like to see it?"`,

"Welcome to the Whispering Woods!" Pip announced proudly.

But their wonder was interrupted by a sad, echoing cry. "Waaaah! Mama! Where are you?"

"Oh no," said Pip, her wings fluttering with worry. "That sounds like someone is lost!"`,

But when they arrived at the river, they found a problem. The old wooden bridge that crossed to the waterfall had broken in half during the last storm.
