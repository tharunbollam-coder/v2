Mushika eagerly peeked — and saw a simple picture of Shiva and Parvati smiling together.  

Surprised, Mushika tilted his head. “But why not draw the whole universe? Isn’t that more important?”`,

Their hearts filled with love — and the paper began to glow with golden light.  

From that day, children learned that no matter how many big things exist in the world, the love and care of parents is the brightest treasure of all.`,
